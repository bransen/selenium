Test Opening Pages:
This code will open each URL in a Chrome browser, wait for 3 seconds, and then compare the expected page title with the actual one. If they match, it will print a success message. If they do not match, it will raise an assertion error. You can modify the URLs and the expected titles as per your needs.
